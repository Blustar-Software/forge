# Session Log

## Current State
- Forge is a SwiftPM CLI with challenges defined in `Sources/forge/Challenges.swift` (now 1–255, including bridge challenges).
- Challenge headers live inside each `starterCode`; the CLI no longer prepends headers when writing files.
- Output validation trims whitespace/newlines before comparison.
- Challenge and project checks are triggered manually by pressing Enter.
- SwiftPM tests exist in `Tests/forgeTests/forgeTests.swift`, plus a check script at `scripts/check.sh`.
- Docs updated: `README.md` includes run/reset + learning overview; `AGENTS.md` includes structure + commands; `ROADMAP.md` added.
- Challenges and projects now support stored hints and solutions.
- Cheatsheets are available via `c`, with shared topic blocks and project-specific blocks.
- Core + Mantle content are implemented; Crust 1–3 challenges and projects are implemented.
- FTS Phase 1 standards are implemented in the engine with constraint profiles, heuristics, and audit tooling.

## Recent Changes
- Drafted an assisted-solution policy: pre-pass solution access requires confirmation, logs assisted passes, and queues short practice after completion (resume after restart if interrupted).
- Completed a full hint audit across Core, Core extras, Mantle (and extras), Crust (and extras), and Bridge to align with hint rules (reduced solution mirroring).
- Tightened a few early hints (e.g., Challenge 1) to avoid “exact output” phrasing while preserving formatting guidance.
- Ran `scripts/check.sh`; all tests passing.
- Added common-mistake diagnostics on output mismatch (missing print, line count mismatch, optional printing, missing calls, basic topic guidance).
- Added adaptive stability guards: require repeated failures by topic or challenge and enforce a short cooldown between adaptive queues.
- Added adaptive stability CLI flags (`--adaptive-topic-failures`, `--adaptive-challenge-failures`, `--adaptive-cooldown`) and documented them in help/README.
- Updated the FTS spec to mark Phase 2 milestone 9.2 as implemented.
- Added tests for diagnostics and adaptive flag parsing; ran `scripts/check.sh` with all tests passing.
- Implemented constraint mastery ladder with persistent state and a warn/block/relax cycle.
- Added stage review debrief summary output.
- Added `forge report` and `forge audit` commands (reporting, sequencing/constraint/fixture audits).
- Added fixture presence audit and constraint mastery tracking to the report.
- Added tests for constraint mastery transitions; ran `scripts/check.sh` with all tests passing.

- Added explicit integration prerequisites with runtime checks that block if required concepts are introduced later in the sequence.
- Added a fixture-backed input file and updated the readLine manual-check instructions to use scripted input.
- Added a fixture-backed args file and updated the command-line arguments manual-check instructions.
- Improved challenge feedback details with numbered expected/actual lines and consistent line-by-line validation in random mode.
- Reduced constraint false positives by stripping comments and string literals (including multiline/raw strings) before regex checks.
- Switched constraint detection to token-based heuristics (with tuple regex fallback) for fewer false positives.
- Added per-topic adaptive attempt tracking to `workspace/.adaptive_stats` as an adaptive progression stub.

## Notes
- Core 2 project `core2a` requires tuple usage; tuples are now taught in Core 2.
- Test runs may require elevated permissions for SwiftPM cache access in sandboxed environments.

## Road Ahead
- Crust: add Crust challenge + project layer, then extras; run sequencing, quality, and overall assessments.
- FTS: apply standards across content/engine and audit for robustness.
- Extras: consider a full curriculum lesson database for deeper, self-contained learning.

- Tightened constraint detection (macro ignores build directives, network string literals, file IO patterns) and added tests.
- Added remap-progress helper function, integration coverage, and curriculum integrity tests.
- Added extensive flag parsing tests and diagnostics tests for common mismatch feedback.
- Made adaptive mode always require confirmation before showing solutions.
- `stats --reset-all` now clears pending assisted practice (`.pending_practice`).
- Added root `Package.resolved` and `.swiftpm/Package.resolved` placeholder (empty pins).
- Removed unstable GitHub Actions CI workflow; local `scripts/ci.sh` remains for manual runs.
- Core 2 arrays: Challenge 30 now requires explicit array type annotation.
- Core 2 sequencing fix: swapped Challenge 34 (Dictionaries) and 35 (Collection Properties), added default-value hint in Challenge 34.
- Collection Properties hints now acknowledge prior count usage.
- Ran `scripts/check.sh`; all tests pass (note: resets adaptive stats/performance log/progress).
- Practice mode now defaults to covered challenges only; use --all to practice across the entire curriculum.
- Practice mode supports sublayer filters: core1/core2/core3, mantle1/2/3, crust1/2/3.
- Practice mode help/examples updated and new parsePracticeArguments test added; ran scripts/check.sh (all tests pass).

- Practice mode now includes extras for reached layers and fixes sublayer ranges for core/mantle/crust practice filters.
- Documented that scripts/check.sh runs swift test and does not reset workspace stats/progress.
- Switched to layered canonical challenge IDs (e.g., core:18, core:18.1), updated practice ranges and help text, and added migrations for progress/stats/logs.
- Bridge challenges now use a dedicated `bridge:<layer>:<n>` namespace and are excluded from covered/practice counts by default (layerIndex=0); added a bridge filter for practice/random/verify/review/audit.
- Centralized practice/random/adaptive pool filtering to avoid bridge/extras drift across code paths.
- Core 3 dictionary iteration now focuses on looping and aggregation (Challenge 44), with a new ordered-keys step added next and later Core 3 challenges renumbered by +1.
- Converted Core mainline/extra TODOs to be more descriptive and moved concrete API/property names into hints where appropriate.
- Challenge filenames now use canonical IDs (e.g., `challenge-core-18.1.swift`, `challenge-bridge-mantle-1.swift`).
- Added `report-overrides` command to suggest extra-parent override candidates, with `--threshold` to tune distance sensitivity.
