1. Add “micro‑failures”

Challenges where the starter code is wrong and the learner must debug it.  

This builds resilience and pattern recognition.

2. Add “constraint mode”

For example:

- “Solve this without using filter.”
- “Solve this using only a while loop.”
- “Solve this using a ternary.”

This mirrors the Link Trainer’s “restricted instrument” drills.

3. Add adaptive difficulty

If a learner solves a challenge quickly, unlock a harder variant.  

If they struggle, unlock a guided version.

4. Add narrative framing

You already have the Forge theme — you could deepen it:

- “The forge is cooling — adjust the airflow.”
- “A shipment arrived — update the inventory.”
- “A new alloy requires precise temperature control.”

Narrative increases retention.

5. Add reflection prompts

After a challenge:

- “What concept did you use here?”
- “What alternative solution could you imagine?”
- “What mistake did you almost make?”

This builds metacognition — the real engine of mastery.
