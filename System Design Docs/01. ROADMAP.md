# Overview
## I. Core
### Core 1
First pass over fundamentals; low-intensity + brief.
### Core 2
Second pass; higher intensity, more reps, more integration.
### Core 3
Final pass over fundamentals; exhaustive coverage + highest integration.

### Core Projects
A. Simple project  
B. Intermediate project  
C. Final, complex project  

Progression: complete at least one project per pass. Optional: repeat or randomize for variety. Final project is open-ended but must demonstrate mastery of concepts.

## II. Mantle
Intermediate-level subject matter with the same 3-pass structure and project gating.

## III. Crust
Advanced/professional subject matter with the same 3-pass structure.

## Status (Current Build)
- Core + Mantle challenges and projects are implemented in the CLI (Challenges 1–171).
- Crust 1–3 challenges are implemented (Challenges 172–237, including extras). Crust projects are implemented.
- Bridge challenges are implemented (Challenges 238–241) to smooth Core → Mantle and Mantle → Crust transitions.
- FTS standards are defined but not yet fully applied across content/engine.

## Road Ahead (Near-Term)
- Crust: add Crust challenges + projects, then extras; run sequencing, quality, and overall assessment.
- FTS: apply standards across curriculum and engine; audit for robustness.
- Extras: consider a full lesson database for deeper, self-contained practice.

## FTS Phase 2+ Tracking (from gap analysis)
- Enforce single-skill isolation or explicit prerequisite checks for integration units.
- Improve challenge feedback (show failing output line/test detail).
- Reduce nondeterminism for manual-check/file I/O units where possible.
- Improve constraint enforcement accuracy (regex → AST) and expand concept coverage beyond regex detection.
- Expand performance logging beyond stage reviews (attempts, errors, timing). (Done: basic attempt logging)

## Remediation Notes (Phase 1 Compliance)
- **Isolation / prerequisites**: audit integration challenges, add prerequisite notes or move later in sequence.
- **Progressive difficulty**: smooth jumps by inserting bridge challenges or adjusting integration placement.
- **Manual-check determinism**: add standardized fixture files and explicit setup steps in challenges.

## Integration Audit (Post-Bridge)
- Integration challenges reviewed after bridge additions; placement and prereqs are consistent with the curriculum sequence.
