# Overview
## I. Core
### Core 1
First pass over fundamentals; low-intensity + brief.
### Core 2
Second pass; higher intensity, more reps, more integration.
### Core 3
Final pass over fundamentals; exhaustive coverage + highest integration.

### Core Projects
A. Simple project  
B. Intermediate project  
C. Final, complex project  

Progression: complete at least one project per pass. Optional: repeat or randomize for variety. Final project is open-ended but must demonstrate mastery of concepts.

## II. Mantle
Intermediate-level subject matter with the same 3-pass structure and project gating.

## III. Crust
Advanced/professional subject matter with the same 3-pass structure.

# Curriculum

## CORE — Fundamental Building Blocks  
Outcome: write, debug, and reason about basic Swift code confidently.

### Core 1 (First Pass — Gentle Introduction)
**Basic Syntax & Types**
- `var`/`let`, basic types, type inference
- Comments, printing, strings + interpolation

**Basic Operations**
- Arithmetic, comparison, logical ops
- Compound assignment

**Functions Basics**
- Define/call, params, returns, naming

### Core 2 (Second Pass — Building Skills)
**Control Flow**
- `if`/`else`, ternary, `switch`, simple pattern matching

**Loops**
- `for-in`, `while`, `repeat-while`, `break`/`continue`
- Ranges

**Collections**
- Arrays, dictionaries, sets
- Iteration patterns

**Optionals Intro**
- `?`, `if let`, `guard let`, `??`, avoiding `!`

### Core 3 (Third Pass — Mastery)
**Functions Advanced**
- External/internal labels (including void argument labels), defaults, variadics, `inout`, nested

**Closures**
- Syntax, trailing closures, capture, shorthand args

**Higher-Order Functions**
- `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `compactMap`, `flatMap`

**Types**
- Tuples, typealiases, enums (cases, raw values, associated values)

**Error Handling Basics**
- `Error`, `throws`, `do/try/catch`, `try?`

**Light I/O & CLI**
- `readLine`, command-line args, simple file read/write

**Testing Foundations**
- XCTest basics, assertions, test naming

## MANTLE — Building Real Programs  
Outcome: structure code with custom types, protocols, and safer architecture.

### Mantle 1 (First Pass)
**Structs**
- Properties, methods, initializers, `self`, mutating, value semantics

**Classes**
- Reference semantics, init/deinit, when to use

**Properties Deep Dive**
- Stored/computed, observers, lazy, static/class

### Mantle 2 (Second Pass)
**Protocols**
- Requirements, conformance, inheritance, composition, types as protocols

**Extensions**
- Adding behavior, default implementations, organization

**Error Handling (Advanced)**
- Propagation, custom error types, `try!`/`try?` tradeoffs

**Access Control**
- `private` -> `open`, usage guidance

### Mantle 3 (Third Pass — Integration)
**Protocol-Oriented Programming**
- Default implementations, conditional conformance, composition

**Generics Fundamentals**
- Generic functions/types, constraints, associated types, where clauses

**Advanced Optionals & Types**
- Optional chaining, IUOs, type casting, `Any`/`AnyObject`, `Result`

**Memory Management**
- ARC, strong/weak/unowned, retain cycles, capture lists

**Enums Advanced**
- `indirect`, methods, computed props, advanced matching

---

## CRUST — Advanced & Professional  
Outcome: build production-grade systems and reason about performance and architecture.

### Crust 1 (First Pass)
**Modern Concurrency**
- `async`/`await`, tasks, structured concurrency, async sequences

**Actors**
- Isolation, `MainActor`, `Sendable`, data race prevention

**Property Wrappers**

**Professional Patterns**
- MVVM/MVC, DI, coordinators, repositories, protocol mocking

**Testing (Advanced)**
- TDD, async testing, stubs/mocks, UI testing concepts

**Advanced Topics**
- Unsafe Swift, C/Obj-C interop, LLDB, diagnostics

**Real-World Skills**
- Logging, analytics, docs, Git workflows, OSS contributions
