*A Link‑Inspired Cognitive Skill Development Framework for Swift Programming*

---

# **1. Purpose**

Forge is a controlled, simulation‑based training environment designed to develop **operational fluency** in Swift programming. The system emphasizes **skill isolation**, **progressive complexity**, **constraint‑driven learning**, and **adaptive feedback**, modeled after the pedagogical principles of the Link Aviation Trainer.

Forge is not a tutorial system, IDE, or problem repository. It is a **training cockpit** for Swift cognition.

---

# **2. System Objectives**

Forge must:

1. Develop deep, automatic, transferable Swift programming skills.  
2. Provide a structured, repeatable training environment.  
3. Use constraints and controlled scenarios to shape correct technique.  
4. Adapt to learner performance to maintain optimal challenge.  
5. Provide immediate, contextual feedback.  
6. Track performance longitudinally to support mastery learning.

# **3. Core Attributes**

## **3.0 Phased Applicability**
Forge will evolve in phases. The following attributes are **Core Requirements (Phase 1)** unless marked as **Phase 2+**. Phase 2+ items are design targets that will be implemented as the training engine matures.

## **3.1 Skill Isolation**
**FTS‑1.1** Each training unit shall target a single cognitive or technical skill.  
**FTS‑1.2** No unit shall introduce secondary concepts until the primary skill is demonstrated.  
**FTS‑1.3** Multi‑skill scenarios shall only be unlocked after prerequisite units are mastered.

---

## **3.2 Controlled Environment (Phase 2+)**
**FTS‑2.1** All exercises shall execute within a constrained sandbox defined by the system.  
**FTS‑2.2** The sandbox shall restrict available APIs, syntax, or tools as required by the training objective.  
**FTS‑2.3** The environment shall prevent unintended escape into general‑purpose Swift execution.

---

## **3.3 Repeatability**
**FTS‑3.1** All training units shall be repeatable with identical initial conditions.  
**FTS‑3.2** The system shall preserve deterministic behavior across repetitions.  
**FTS‑3.3** The learner shall be able to repeat any unit without penalty.

---

## **3.4 Safe Failure**
**FTS‑4.1** Errors shall be non‑destructive and contained within the sandbox.  
**FTS‑4.2** Failure shall be treated as diagnostic, not evaluative.  
**FTS‑4.3** The system shall prevent learner frustration by ensuring recoverability from all error states.

---

## **3.5 Immediate, Contextual Feedback (Phase 2+)**
**FTS‑5.1** Feedback shall be delivered quickly enough to feel immediate for the current runtime environment.  
**FTS‑5.2** Feedback shall reference the specific action or code fragment that triggered it.  
**FTS‑5.3** Feedback shall include both *what* failed and *why* it failed.

---

## **3.6 Progressive Difficulty**
**FTS‑6.1** Difficulty shall increase only after mastery criteria are met.  
**FTS‑6.2** Each difficulty level shall build directly on the previous one.  
**FTS‑6.3** The system shall not introduce unrelated complexity at any stage.

---

## **3.7 Scenario‑Based Learning**
**FTS‑7.1** Each unit shall define a clear objective, constraints, and success criteria.  
**FTS‑7.2** Scenarios shall simulate real cognitive demands without requiring real project context.  
**FTS‑7.3** Scenarios shall be structured, not open‑ended.

---

## **3.8 Adaptive Challenge (Phase 2+)**
**FTS‑8.1** The system shall adjust difficulty based on learner performance metrics.  
**FTS‑8.2** Adaptation shall include scaffolding, challenge escalation, or turbulence (edge cases).  
**FTS‑8.3** Adaptation shall occur without explicit learner request.

---

## **3.9 Constraint‑Driven Mastery (Phase 2+)**
**FTS‑9.1** Constraints shall be used to enforce correct technique.  
**FTS‑9.2** Constraints may include:  
- restricted syntax  
- limited APIs  
- disabled autocomplete  
- forced explicitness  
**FTS‑9.3** Constraints shall be gradually relaxed as mastery increases.

---

## **3.10 Embodied Cognitive Skill Formation**
**FTS‑10.1** Training shall target automaticity, not declarative knowledge.  
**FTS‑10.2** Units shall reinforce pattern recognition and reflexive responses.  
**FTS‑10.3** The system shall prioritize cognitive load shaping over content coverage.

---

## **3.11 Instructor‑Like Guidance**
**FTS‑11.1** The system shall monitor learner performance continuously.  
**FTS‑11.2** Guidance shall be corrective, directive, and structured.  
**FTS‑11.3** Guidance shall maintain psychological safety and avoid punitive framing.

---

## **3.12 Syllabus‑Driven Progression**
**FTS‑12.1** The system shall define a hierarchical training syllabus.  
**FTS‑12.2** Each stage shall include entry criteria, objectives, and exit criteria.  
**FTS‑12.3** Learners shall not bypass stages without demonstrated competence.

---

## **3.13 Modular Architecture**
**FTS‑13.1** Training units shall be modular and independently loadable.  
**FTS‑13.2** Modules shall compose into higher‑order skills.  
**FTS‑13.3** New modules shall be integrable without altering existing progression.

---

## **3.14 Cognitive Fidelity**
**FTS‑14.1** The system shall simulate the cognitive demands of Swift programming, not full project realism.  
**FTS‑14.2** Fidelity shall prioritize mental models, not environmental accuracy.  
**FTS‑14.3** Real‑world complexity shall be introduced only when pedagogically justified.

---

## **3.15 Performance Logging and Debriefing (Phase 2+)**
**FTS‑15.1** The system shall log attempts, errors, timings, and behavioral patterns.  
**FTS‑15.2** Debriefing shall summarize performance relative to objectives.  
**FTS‑15.3** Debriefing shall include recommendations for next steps.

---

# **4. System Components**

## **4.1 Training Engine**
Executes units, enforces constraints, and evaluates learner actions.

## **4.2 Feedback Engine**
Generates contextual, real‑time feedback.

## **4.3 Adaptation Engine**
Adjusts difficulty and scaffolding based on performance.

## **4.4 Syllabus Manager**
Controls progression, prerequisites, and module sequencing.

## **4.5 Telemetry Layer**
Captures performance metrics and supports debriefing.

---

# **5. Mastery Criteria**

A learner is considered to have mastered a unit when:

1. They complete the unit successfully **N consecutive times** (N configurable).  
2. Their error rate falls below a defined threshold.  
3. Their completion time stabilizes within a target range.  
4. They demonstrate correct technique under constraint.

---

# **6. Non‑Goals**

Forge shall not:

- Serve as a general Swift IDE  
- Provide open‑ended project environments  
- Replace documentation or tutorials  
- Allow arbitrary code execution outside the training sandbox  
- Prioritize realism over cognitive fidelity  

---

# **7. Compliance**

A Forge implementation is considered Link‑faithful at **Phase 1** if it satisfies all Phase 1 requirements. Full compliance (including Phase 2+ requirements) is a target for later phases.
