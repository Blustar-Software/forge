## Forge Evolution Roadmap (Scoped to Current CLI)

### Phase 1 — No Engine Changes
- Add narrative framing to challenge descriptions in `Sources/forge/Challenges.swift`.
- Add reflection prompts after successful validation in `Sources/forge/forge.swift`.
- Introduce 3–5 “micro‑failure” challenges with intentionally wrong starter code.

### Phase 2 — Light Engine Changes
- Add constraint metadata to `Challenge` (e.g., `constraints: [String]`) and display it in the prompt.
- Add simple constraint checks where feasible (for example, forbid `filter` or require `while` via string checks).

### Phase 3 — Adaptive Difficulty
- Add telemetry logging (attempt count, time‑to‑pass) to a local log file.
- Define harder/guided variants and branch based on performance metrics.
