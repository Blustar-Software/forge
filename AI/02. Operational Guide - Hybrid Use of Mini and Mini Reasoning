# Operational Guide: Hybrid Use of Phi-4 Mini and Phi-4 Mini Reasoning

## 1. Model Roles

| Model | Primary Role | Use Case Examples |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Mini** | Deterministic, format-compliant output | JSON/YAML generation, API-ready structured data, exact prompt execution |
| **Mini Reasoning** | Logical analysis and multi-step problem solving | Planning, debugging, abstract reasoning, candidate solution exploration |

---

## 2. Recommended Workflow

### Reasoning Phase (Mini Reasoning)
- Tasks:
  - Step-by-step logic
  - Deduction or inference
  - Multi-step reasoning challenges
- Output can be verbose; focus on accuracy over format compliance.

### Compliance Phase (Mini)
- Tasks:
  - Convert outputs from Reasoning Phase into strict, structured outputs
  - Enforce formatting rules (JSON, CSV, YAML)
  - Validate against schemas or output constraints

**Example Flow:**

```
[Prompt Reasoning Task] → Mini Reasoning → Analyze step-by-step solution
↓
[Generate structured output] → Mini → JSON/YAML compliant
```

## 3. Task Classification

| Task Type | Recommended Model | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Structured data output | Mini | Ensures exact compliance with schemas |
| Logical puzzles / abstract reasoning | Mini Reasoning | Focus on correctness and multi-step logic |
| Testing / validation | Both | Reasoning explores possibilities; Mini enforces format |
| Exploratory analysis | Mini Reasoning | Candidate solutions, multi-step decomposition |
| Production pipelines | Mini | Deterministic, API-safe output |

---

## 4. Best Practices

- **Separate reasoning from formatting**: Never rely on Reasoning model for strict output in pipelines.
- **Use Mini for validation**: Ensure machine-readability even if Reasoning output is correct.
- **Optional iterative loop**: Feed selected Reasoning output to Mini for structured output generation.
- **Limit verbose output in pipelines**: Apply truncation or summarization when using Reasoning in production.

---

## 5. Summary

This guide establishes a hybrid workflow:

1. **Mini Reasoning**: Handles abstract, multi-step, and logical reasoning tasks.
2. **Mini**: Produces format-compliant, deterministic outputs suitable for structured pipelines.

The approach balances reasoning capability with output reliability, making it safe for both exploratory analysis and production-ready data generation.
