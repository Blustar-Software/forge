**Operators** are unique characters or phrases that Swift uses to manipulate and validate values. Swift was specifically designed to enhance the operators from several programming languages to create more capability with less code for the programmer.

## Operators

[Advanced Operators](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/swift/operators/advanced-operators)

Advanced operators in Swift provide the programmer with increased functionality and complex value manipulation. They include compound assignments, bitwise, and custom operators, to name a few.

[Basic Operators](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/swift/operators/basic-operators)

Basic operators in Swift are commonly used to evaluate, reassign, and combine values.
