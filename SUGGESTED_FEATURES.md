# Suggested Features (Post‑Testing)

1) Add a small practice “selection debug” line (topic mix + range buckets used).
2) Add a confirmation line after `forge progress` (e.g., “Progress set to …”).
3) Add `forge practice --last` to summarize the most recent practice set.
4) Treat assisted passes as neutral for topic score (do not reduce adaptive pressure).
5) Add a short “error decoding” micro‑lesson after repeated compile failures.
